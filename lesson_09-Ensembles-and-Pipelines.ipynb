    "# Ensemble Methods and Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "We could spend an entire course on ensemble methods.  Ensembles combine more than one model in some systematic way. In practice, data scientists do this because it helps them predict outcomes with more accuracy and with less bias than any single method does.  Because there are thousands of possible algorithms that can be combined in what are effectively limitless ways, there is no way to cover all of ensemble methods.  Instead, we will discuss one particular ensemble method, RANDOM FORESTS, that is very widely used.  You should be aware, however, that the idea of combining multiple relatively \"weak\" machine learning methods into a single \"strong\" machine learning method is quite common, and that most sophisticated machine learning models do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also in this assignment, we will introduce the idea of a \"pipeline\", a collection of steps that you can use to automate much of your data science process so that testing modifications and variations is relatively simple and straightforward.  Pipelines require a little getting used to, but they are worth the effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than run through a bunch of explanations, we're going to build an ensemble model, then talk about what it does. Then we'll do the same for a pipeline. "

    "We changed the model we used from LogisticRegression to RandomForestClassifier. What is that, and why did that change increase the average precision?  \n",
    "\n",
    "A logistic regression is an example of a linear model, which assumes that the relationship between each feature and the output class is a linear one. For example, if one of the features is the depth of a well, a linear model will assume that (all other things being equal) the difference in functionality between a 10-year-old and a 50-year-old  will be the same as the difference between 40-year-old and 90-year-old. This isn’t always a valid assumption. One way to address it is to add extra features like age squared and the logarithm of age, which helps a linear model capture nonlinearities, but might not still allow me to get all the nuances of nonlinear relationships.A logistic regression also doesn’t capture interactions between features. I can explicitly add interaction terms to the logistic regression, but this gets unwieldy fast when I have many features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree can capture interactions and nonlinearities much more naturally than logistic regression, because of the binary tree structure of the decision tree algorithm itself. The downside of decision trees is that they can be harder to interpret or assign uncertainties to their predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random forest is a collection of decision trees, each of which is trained on a subset of the rows/columns of the training data. The randomness in the training set means that the individual trees in a random forest are high-variance, but low-bias, and the final prediction is made by having each tree classify a given event and then using their predictions as “votes,” with the majority opinion being assigned as the label. Nonlinearities and interactions are captured by the individual trees, but ensembling many trees into a random forest tends to cancel out the biases/shortcomings of any one tree producing a stronger predictor overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "In empirical studies of many algorithms being applied to many supervised learning problems, random forests often come out on top overall. So when in doubt, or if I only have the time/resources to try one model, a random forest is likely to get at or near the peak performance of all the algorithms on the market.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Random forest components\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests do not have a single canonical form.  Sci-Kit Learn has great defaults, but under the covers there are some important parameters that you may need to tune.  These include \"max_features\", \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### max_features\n",
    "\n",
    "max_features sets the maximum number of features in an individual tree and is probably the most important parameter. The more features allowed, the more computations (and thus time) required. Also, the greater chance of overfitting.  Here are a few standard options for this parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Auto/None : This will simply take all the features which make sense in every tree.Here we simply do not put any restrictions on the individual tree.\n",
    "- sqrt : This option will take square root of the total number of features in individual run. For instance, if the total number of variables are 100, we can only take 10 of them in individual tree.”log2″ is another similar type of option for max_features.\n",
    "- 0.2 : This option allows the random forest to take 20% of variables in individual run. We can assign and value in a format “0.x” where we want x% of features to be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### max_depth\n",
    "\n",
    "max_depth sets the maximum  depth of the tree. By default, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.  Because tree depth can be quite deep with lots of features, this adds another way to reduce overfitting and increase speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### n_estimators \n",
    "\n",
    "n_estimators sets the number of trees built before each \"weak learning\" tree votes. More trees means more computation and thus more time. But this does not risk overfitting. You should choose as high value as your processor can handle because this makes your predictions stronger and more stable. sklearn defaults to ten.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### min_sample_leaf\n",
    "\n",
    "min_sample_leave (minimum sample leaf size) sets how many outcome votes have to exist for a leaf to have any way.  Smaller leaf makes the model more prone to overfitting. But if you don't have much data, it's best to start with the default (1).  If you think you are overfitting, you can increase that number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### oob_score\\\n",
    "Finally, we can use a kind of internal cross validation special to random forests to estimate the generalization accuracy. This really helps reduce overfitting, but also cuts out potentially important edge cases your classifier might identify. \n",
    "\n",
    "To set a parameter, you just add it inside the parentheses after the model name.  Like so: \n",
